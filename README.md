# BankAccount
For this project, I wanted to create a bank account template. 
This account will be animated by money movements. For example, funds can be deposited or withdrawn. 

In addition, there are 3 types of bank account: savings accounts, high-interest accounts and blocked accounts, which are a subclass of high-interest accounts. 

I used object-oriented python to create this model.
